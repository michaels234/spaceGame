When flying:
Space: boost forward
Shift+Space: boost backward
Mouse movement: body rotation

F: magnetic boots on/off

When magnetized to a surface:
Space: jump
WASD: body movement
Mouse movement: body rotation

Left click: do item action (currently only light switch on wall)

Tips:

If too far away from a surface or moving too fast past a surface,
the magnetic boots may not be strong enough to pull you to the surface.

When flying toward some desired point, slow down before you get there,
otherwise you'll fly past.

Watch your speedometer to get an idea of whether you're moving
away or toward a desired point. But remember speed is non-directional,
it's only magnitude.

Remember if you're moving perpendicular to a desired point,
and facing the desired point and boosting toward it,
that creates an orbit. To go toward the desired point,
you'll have to decrease your perpendicular velocity.
