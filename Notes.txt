	new features
		basic key features (not all are listed)
			planets
				spawn, fly by, disappear
				remember locations of spawned planets and their characteristics
			ship
				ability to decompress / recompress (air in / out / low oxygen etc.)
				cockpit (lol)
					player sits in pilot seat, can control ship movement
				ability to warp to new areas
					warp to specific place visible on map
					far matter warp
						warp randomly to unknown area outside of map but it has detectable matter
						warp to stars and planets and typical stuff. you usually want to warp this way if you far warp
					far warp
						warp randomly to anywhere at all outside of map
						this won't usually be used, because a very very high percent of the time this will warp you to empty space (not interesting)
						but sometimes, rarely, it will warp to something that isn't detectable matter, and there you can find sick and rare shit
			player
				
			other
				vr controls
		needed for ease of play
			player
***				screen pointer showing direction of set point (ship), at first instead of custom point, could be last touched
					getting there! but everythings backward. it only shows when ship is on screen. and directions are all opposite. and it switches at a certain spot too.
		appearances
			player
				instead of magnet on off written on screen, lightup shoe colors
				sounds and visible air tufts for backpack directioning / boosting
				player shape instead of rectangle
				appearance of suit vs no suit
				player movement animation instead of static shap
				walking sounds
			ship
				ship shape (lol)
					multiple rooms, doors, stairs, ramps, etc.
		other
			speed is relative. if ship is going at speed A, player speed is A plus the speed relative to the ship.
				we don't always care about that though. And what is the ships speed A relative to?
				the ground from which it took off from last? need to be able to set what is speed relative to.
	bugs
		player
			direction pointer UI clitches for just 1 point, probly at switch of z coordinate
			when you turn off magnet shoes, camera snaps to looking forward
				want to slerp to looking forward (maybe done?)
			torqueing to when laying down doesnt smoothely transition to standing, tho i can't find a way to fix it 40 degrees works best in every other way. but why 40???????
			in some cases, it gets stuck grounded with feet not flat on the surface
				line 158: need to check foot is perpendicular instead, and distance, tho distance is having an issue now so maybe a less than kinda thing
			sometimes walls still flip out the camera when changing camera distance to  go in front of walls
			sometimes player gets stuck on a corner and wierd shit happens
DONE
	player
		UI
			speed indicator
			magnet shoes on / off indicator
			pointer showing direction of set point (ship for now, later could be last touched place, or a custom set point)
		walking controls
			walk and look around
			jump
		flying controls
			air boost forward / backward
			air boost rotation
		magnet shoes controls
			power on / off
			locking on to magnetic material and magnetizing toward / losing lock-on / sticking landing
	ship
		basic shape to walk on and magnetize to
		one pressable button, controls lights on / off
	planets
		not active yet, foundation has been started though
NOTES
	traveling
		Normal booster engine travel (1 planet scale)
		Normal warp on map, in radar radius. Always in same galaxy forever
		Far warp outside of galaxy. Not directional, 2 types: random, or to a galaxy I've been
	universe
		Galaxies are too big to see more than one on a map
		The map is super big actually, so flying with engines barely gets you anywhere at all on the map. Super slow. You warp on the map from place to place. Wherever you go you are always the center of the map, so as you move, things go in and out of view on the map. Say you warp to a planet on the map, engines are just used to move around the planet and it's moons.
		Galaxies never hit each other. So basically no galaxy interaction.
		You can't warp outside the map with the normal warp you use inside, because you don't know what's out there and you could warp into the center of a star. And also let's just saw normal warp distance is same as visibility distance.
		So here's what I'm thinking could make things easy.
		Anywhere you normal warp, it's always same galaxy. Galaxy is essentially endless.
		To leave a galaxy you must do a far warp. This warps you out of galaxy and maybe there may be nothing. Then sometimes you find a new galaxy. You saved warp coords of the Galaxy you were in so you can warp back to it. The coords tho aren't really on a map, like galaxies aren't anywhere really, they're just a list. There's no direction to find them. Know what I mean?
